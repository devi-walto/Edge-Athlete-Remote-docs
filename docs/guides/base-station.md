this guide — the operator's manual for the base station.
Deliberately SHORT at the top: the install is two commands, and a page that buries
them under a wall of reference is a page nobody reads to the end. Everything else is
still here, folded into dropdowns, so the page skims in a minute and still answers
the 2am question. If you add to this file, add inside a dropdown.

# Getting started with the base station

:::{note}
Day-to-day operation. For the decisions behind this setup — the install location, the
Wi-Fi agent, why a failed access point does not stop the app — see {doc}`../journal/scripts`.
:::

The whole system runs as one Docker stack on the base station. No cloud, no internet
dependency, no subscription: the box broadcasts its own private Wi-Fi and serves
everything itself.

## Install it

```bash
scp scripts/basestation/bootstrap.sh edgeathlete@basestation:/tmp/
ssh -t edgeathlete@basestation 'sudo bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh'
```

The first run prints **this machine's own public key** and waits. Add it on GitHub —
the repo → **Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key** — and leave **"Allow write
access" unchecked**. Then press Enter and it carries on.

:::{note}
**Why not a `curl … | sudo bash` one-liner?** There used to be one, and it needed the
repo to be public. This one is private, and GitHub answers an anonymous download from
a private repo with a 404 — so the old one-liner would hand `sudo bash` an empty
script, which does nothing and says nothing. `-t` on the `ssh` matters: without a
terminal there is nothing to wait on, so it prints the key and stops.
:::

**To update later: `ea-update`.** Re-running this file also works — it is not
one-shot.

Three scripts, in order:

| | |
|---|---|
| `scripts/basestation/bootstrap.sh` | installs git, enrols this machine's deploy key, clones to `/srv/edge-athlete/Edge-Athlete`, hands off |
| `scripts/basestation/setup.sh` | Docker, Chromium, the Wi-Fi config, the boot service, the short commands |
| `scripts/basestation/startup.sh` | runs on every boot: access point up, then the stack |

Then change the Wi-Fi password — it ships as a default:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/edgeathlete/basestation.conf
sudo systemctl restart edgeathlete.service
```

Join the **EdgeAthlete** network and open **http://basestation**.

## The short commands

On the box, from any shell. No sourcing, no re-login.

| | |
|---|---|
| `ea-update` | pull latest code and rebuild |
| `ea-seed` | load the demo session, athletes and coach |
| `ea-sim` | start the fake rack sensor |
| `ea-reset` | tear the stack down, update, and bring it back up (database kept) |
| `ea-reset-hard` | same, and wipe the database too (then re-seed) |
| `ea-kiosk-exit` | leave a full-screen screen for the desktop |
| `ea-help` | the full list |

`ea-reset` is the "just make it work again" command: it removes the running
containers (the step `ea-update` deliberately skips — a rebuilt image does not
restart a running container), pulls latest code, and starts fresh containers
from the freshly built images. `ea-reset-hard` adds `-v` to the compose down, so
the postgres volume is deleted too and the demo data is re-seeded — which means
re-assigning any NFC wristbands afterwards (the seeder does not set them).

Rack screens get their own smaller set — `ea-update`, `ea-restart`, `ea-kiosk-log`.
Same names, different device, different behaviour. See {doc}`../journal/scripts`.

## On a monitor

Plug one in and it boots to the wall display, no password. Three launchers are in the
app list — Wall Display, Rack Screen, Coach — all opening full-screen.

Two limits worth knowing before you debug something that is not broken:

- **Full-screen here is not a cage.** Hover the top edge for the toolbar, F11 to
  leave, close to close. Only real rack screens in the gym are locked, and only those
  reopen themselves — that is what `ea-kiosk-exit` is for.
- **These launchers use `localhost`, and gym screens do not.** `localhost` is a
  trusted origin, so the offline cache, app install and Bluetooth all work here and
  are switched off over `http://basestation`. **A bug that reproduces on a rack but
  not on this machine is often that difference, not a coincidence.**

## Rack screens

A rack screen is the other half of a gym, and it has its own page:
{doc}`rack-screen`.

Worth knowing from here: it is a **client**, not a second server. It joins this
base station's Wi-Fi and boots into a locked browser — no Docker, no database, no
access point of its own.

```bash
scp scripts/rack-screen/rack-bootstrap.sh pi@<screen>:/tmp/
ssh -t pi@<screen> 'sudo bash /tmp/rack-bootstrap.sh'
```

Use whatever account the screen was imaged with in place of `pi`. Like the base
station, the first run prints the screen's public key and waits while you add it as a
read-only deploy key.

**To update later: `ea-update`** on the screen.

⚠️ **Run that on the screen, not here.** The two `ea-update` commands resolve to
different bootstraps, and installing the base station's on a tablet would give it a
server it has no use for and stand up a second access point competing with the real
one for the air the gym runs on.

## Reference

Everything below is folded away on purpose. Open what you need.

:::{dropdown} The services, and what each one does

Every service is defined in `docker-compose.yml` and shares one private Docker
network, so services reach each other by name (e.g. `postgres`, `mosquitto`).

| Service | Port(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | 5432 (internal) | PostgreSQL database — the single source of durable data. Only set-level data is ever written here. |
| `mosquitto` | 1883 (MQTT), 9001 (MQTT-over-WebSockets) | The message broker. Nodes + Django use 1883; browsers connect directly to 9001. |
| `django` | 8000 (internal) | The web/REST server (sync `runserver`). Handles all `/api/` and `/admin/` requests. |
| `mqtt-listener` | — | The ONE MQTT subscriber process. Listens to node pulse topics and updates node health. |
| `react` | 80 (internal) | Builds the front-end to static files and serves them via its own Nginx. |
| `nginx` | 80 (published) | The front door. Routes `/api/`, `/admin/`, `/static/*` to Django and everything else to React. |
| `seed` | — | **On demand only.** Fills an empty database with a demo gym. Profile-gated, so `docker compose up` never starts it. See **Seeding demo data** (in Reference, below). |
| `simulator` | — | **On demand only.** A fake rack sensor for demos without hardware. Also profile-gated. See **Running a demo without hardware** (in Reference, below). |

> There is exactly ONE MQTT listener service (`mqtt-listener`). The reference
> project ran a second, duplicate listener — it has been removed here.
:::

:::{dropdown} Running the tests — read this before trusting a green run
**The Django image contains a *copy* of the source. There is no live mount.** So this
tests whatever you last built, not what is on disk:

```bash
docker compose run --rm django python manage.py test event_handler
```

Edit a file, run that, and you can get a confident pass that never saw your change.
It has already happened once during this project: a whole suite reported OK while the
edit under test was not in the image.

Build first, every time:

```bash
docker compose build django
docker compose run --rm django python manage.py test event_handler
```

The frontend has no such trap — Vite reads the working tree directly:

```bash
cd react && npx vitest run
```

**This does not affect the base station.** `ea-update` runs `setup.sh`, which builds
the images as part of provisioning, so a deployed box is always on current code. The
trap is local development only.

Why it is worth a note rather than a fix: the failure mode is a **passing** test run.
Nothing errors, nothing looks wrong, and the result is wrong in the direction you were
hoping for — which is the hardest kind to catch by noticing.
:::

:::{dropdown} Start, stop, and watch logs

From the repo root (where `docker-compose.yml` lives):

```bash
# Start the whole stack (build images the first time or after changes)
docker compose up --build          # add -d to run detached in the background

# Stop it (containers stop, data volumes persist)
docker compose down

# Stop AND wipe the database volume (destructive — fresh start)
docker compose down -v

# Watch logs for one service
docker compose logs -f django
docker compose logs -f mqtt-listener
```

First boot builds the Django and React images and runs database migrations
automatically (via the Dockerfile / listener command). The app is reachable at
`http://<pi-ip>/` (or `http://localhost/` on the dev host).
:::

:::{dropdown} Demo data: what seeding creates

A freshly migrated database is empty — no athletes, no session, and no coach
login, so `/coach` cannot even be signed into. One command fills it:

```bash
docker compose run --rm seed
```

That gives you a live training day ("Thursday — Lower + Push"), four athletes,
the plan they train, recorded reference maxes, two already-finished sets, and the
demo coach login (`coach` / `coachpass`).

**`seed` is a one-shot, and it is invisible to `docker compose up`.** It carries a
Compose *profile*, which means the service does not exist unless you name it —
demo data can never appear on its own at boot.

Running it again is safe. The seeder converges instead of piling up: it closes
whatever day was left open, reuses the group's existing plan rather than
deploying a second one, and matches its own rows by name. Two runs leave exactly
**one** open session, which is the rule the whole app depends on (canon D18).

> ⚠️ **`--reset` is not passed, on purpose.** The seeder's reset flag deletes the
> rows it thinks are its own, but it matches them **by name** — on a real base
> station that would take out a group genuinely called "Varsity", plus any athlete
> sharing a name with the demo four, and their sets with them. On a laptop, where
> that is fine, ask for it explicitly:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose run --rm seed python manage.py seed_active_session --reset
> ```
:::

:::{dropdown} Running a demo with no hardware

The `simulator` service is a fake rack sensor. It publishes the same pulse and
rep messages a real node would, on the same topics, so the tablet and the wall
display can be demoed with nothing bolted to a rack.

```bash
docker compose --profile demo up -d simulator     # runs until you stop it
docker compose logs -f simulator                  # watch it decide
docker compose --profile demo down simulator      # stop it
```

**It stays quiet until the rack is actually being used.** By default the rep
stream is gated on a set being open at the linked rack, so a demo reads like
this:

| What the room is doing | What the node publishes |
|---|---|
| No training day running | pulses only |
| Day running, nobody at the rack | pulses only |
| Athlete checked in, between sets | pulses only |
| **Set open at that rack** | **pulses + reps** |
| Set ended | pulses only |

The heartbeat never stops, on purpose — pulses are how Django knows the node is
alive, so going quiet on those would make an idle rack look like a dead one.

The rack it watches comes from the **node's own database row**, re-read every
couple of seconds. Link the sensor to a rack mid-demo and it wakes up on its
own; there is nothing to restart.

Loosen the gate with `--active-when` if you want a chattier demo:

| Mode | Publishes reps when |
|---|---|
| `lifting` *(default)* | a set is open at the rack |
| `checkin` | anyone is checked in there, set or no set |
| `always` | never pauses — the behaviour from before the gate existed |

Simulating a second rack needs no compose edit:

```bash
docker compose run --rm simulator python manage.py simulate_node --node-id rack_2
```

> The gate reads the database directly rather than calling
> `GET /api/sessions/active/status/`. It is a management command, so it is
> already inside the ORM — the HTTP route would be the same rows with a web
> server and a base URL in the way. It reuses `active_session()` for "which day
> is live", so it can never disagree with the screens about that (canon D18).
:::

:::{dropdown} Database migrations and rollback

Migrations apply automatically on Django boot. To roll one back, migrate the app
to the migration you want to land on — Django reverses everything after it:

```bash
# Roll back to a specific migration (undoes every later one for this app).
# Example: undo the AthleteReferenceMax table (0003) and land on 0002.
docker exec edgeathlete-django python manage.py migrate event_handler 0002_set_weight_lbs

# See what's applied / what a rollback would undo
docker exec edgeathlete-django python manage.py showmigrations event_handler
```

There are no separate "down" files — each migration reverses itself. Schema
migrations (add/drop a table or column) roll back cleanly. The one thing to
watch: a **data** migration (one that moves or backfills rows, `RunPython`) only
reverses if someone wrote its reverse step — otherwise it's one-way.

**There are six data migrations.** Four restore or safely discard generated data;
`0018` and `0019` deliberately cannot reconstruct cleared legacy mappings:

| | What it moves | Reverse |
|---|---|---|
| `0005` | Text exercise names → catalog links | Writes the names back |
| `0009` | Seeds the starter movement catalog | Deletes exactly the rows it added |
| `0013` | Backfills "last edited" from "created" | `noop` — rolling back drops the column anyway |
| `0015` | Each group's single coach → the staff table | Puts the head coach back |
| `0018` | Clears duplicate rack-node mappings before adding uniqueness | Leaves current explicit mappings intact; cleared legacy mappings must be restored from a pre-migration database backup and reselected at each rack |
| `0019` | Clears MQTT-unsafe assigned node IDs before adding its constraint | Leaves current explicit mappings intact; cleared legacy mappings must be restored from backup and reselected after correcting the node ID |

Anything you add from here needs the same treatment — see
{doc}`migrations`, which is the full
guide to changing this schema safely.
:::

:::{dropdown} Config files, and where they live

| File | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `.env` | Real runtime values (DB login, MQTT host, Django secret). **Gitignored.** |
| `.env.example` | Committed template of `.env` with blank values. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Which services run and how they're wired together. |
| `mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` | The broker's two listeners: 1883 (MQTT) + 9001 (WebSockets). |
| `nginx/nginx.conf` | Reverse-proxy routing: `/api/`, `/admin/`, `/static/*` → Django, `/` → React. |
| `django/basestation_config/settings.py` | Django configuration (reads everything from `.env`). |
:::

:::{dropdown} MQTT test commands

The broker allows anonymous connections through Sprint 3, so these work with no auth.

```bash
# Watch every Edge Athlete topic (run in its own terminal)
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'edgeathlete/#' -v

# Publish a fake pulse and confirm the subscriber above sees it
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t edgeathlete/node/test/pulse -m '{}'
```

Browser check (proves the 9001 WebSockets door works — this is the path all
three screen types use). In a browser JS console with an `mqtt.js` client:

```js
const c = mqtt.connect(`ws://${location.hostname}:9001`);
c.on('connect', () => c.subscribe('edgeathlete/node/test/pulse'));
c.on('message', (t, m) => console.log(t, m.toString()));
// then, from a terminal:
//   mosquitto_pub -t edgeathlete/node/test/pulse -m '{}'
// the console should log the message.
```
:::

:::{dropdown} When something is wrong

Every one of these has actually happened. They are ordered by how often.

**`ea-update: command not found`**
The commands are symlinks in `/usr/local/bin` pointing at `scripts/basestation/ea.sh`.
If they are missing, the last `setup.sh` did not finish. Re-run the install command —
it is not one-shot — or call the script directly:
`sudo /srv/edge-athlete/Edge-Athlete/scripts/basestation/ea.sh update`.

They used to be shell *functions* dropped in `/etc/profile.d`, which only login shells
read. That is why this used to come back after every reboot. If it still does, you are
running an old install.

**HTTP 502 on some pages, usually the coach ones**
Nginx is up and Django is not. Almost always a container that failed to restart after
an update:

```bash
cd /srv/edge-athlete/Edge-Athlete
sudo docker compose ps          # anything not "running"?
sudo docker compose logs django --tail 50
```

**The demo runs, but no reps arrive**
A node that has not registered is rejected, and the rejection is quiet. `ea-sim`
registers its node on startup; anything older did not. Check the simulator is actually
saying something:

```bash
ea-sim-log
```

Then confirm the node shows up unassigned on the coach admin page and link it to a
rack. A sensor publishing into a rack it was never linked to looks perfectly healthy
in its own log.

**A rebuild "succeeded" but behaviour did not change**
Two separate traps, both silent:

- The Django image **bakes the source in**. There is no volume mount, so editing a
  file changes nothing until `sudo docker compose build django`.
- `docker compose build` **skips profile-gated services**. The seeder and the
  simulator sit behind `--profile seed` and `--profile demo`, so a plain build leaves
  them on whatever code they were last built with — which can be months old. `ea-seed`
  and `ea-sim` now build their own image first; a hand-run `docker compose` will not.

**The box takes about two minutes to boot**
It is waiting on a network service that manages nothing here. `setup.sh` masks
`systemd-networkd-wait-online` for this reason. If a machine still stalls:

```bash
systemd-analyze blame | head
```

**No EdgeAthlete Wi-Fi network**
The adapter cannot do AP mode, which cannot be scripted around. The app still comes up
over a cable — the startup log says so plainly rather than failing silently:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u edgeathlete.service -e
```

**Works on the base station's own screen, broken on a rack**
Check the address bar before anything else. The local launchers use `localhost`, which
browsers treat as a trusted origin; rack screens use `http://basestation`, which they
do not. The offline cache, app install and Bluetooth are all switched off on the second
one. This difference is a real cause of "it only breaks in the gym", not a coincidence
— {doc}`../journal/rack-tablet` has the full reasoning.

**The wall display sits on stale numbers**
It refetches when the server announces a change, and backs that up with a poll every
twenty seconds. If it is stuck for longer than that, the browser lost the broker
rather than the data being wrong. Reload it.
:::

:::{dropdown} Install reference: paths, service, first-boot flags

One command on a fresh machine. It installs Docker, pulls the code, writes the
boot service, and builds the stack:

```bash
scp scripts/basestation/bootstrap.sh edgeathlete@basestation:/tmp/
ssh -t edgeathlete@basestation 'sudo bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh'
```

The first run prints **this machine's own public key** and waits. Add it on GitHub —
the repo → **Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key** — and leave **"Allow write
access" unchecked**. Then press Enter and it carries on.

:::{note}
**Why not a `curl … | sudo bash` one-liner?** There used to be one, and it needed the
repo to be public. This one is private, and GitHub answers an anonymous download from
a private repo with a 404 — so the old one-liner would hand `sudo bash` an empty
script, which does nothing and says nothing. `-t` on the `ssh` matters: without a
terminal there is nothing to wait on, so it prints the key and stops.
:::

**To update later: `ea-update`.** Re-running this file also works — it is not
one-shot.

| | Path |
|---|---|
| The install | `/srv/edge-athlete/Edge-Athlete` |
| This machine's Wi-Fi settings | `/etc/edgeathlete/basestation.conf` (**not** in git) |
| Boot service | `edgeathlete.service` |

Then, before the gym uses it:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/edgeathlete/basestation.conf   # AP_PASSWORD is still the default
sudo systemctl restart edgeathlete.service
```

Nothing depends on which user is logged in, and the scripts work from wherever
the repo was cloned. Full detail — including what to do when the access point
won't start — is in {doc}`../journal/scripts`.

A coach can also change the Wi-Fi password from the coach admin page. It applies
live via a host agent, and **disconnects every device** — tablets, wall display,
and each rack Pi — which must then rejoin by hand. It's a walk-around; do it
between sessions. See "Changing the Wi-Fi password" in
{doc}`../journal/scripts`.
:::

:::{dropdown} The long-form first install, step by step

Clean Linux machine to a running base station. Run the same command again later to
**update** a box — it is not one-shot.

### Before you start

- **Debian or Ubuntu** on the mini PC (x86).
- A **Wi-Fi adapter that supports AP mode** — the base station broadcasts its own
  network, so setup refuses without one. Check: `iw list | grep -A5 "Supported interface modes"` (look for `AP`).
- **Internet for the install only** (to pull Docker + build images). It runs fully offline after that.
- **sudo/root** access.

### 1. Install — copy the bootstrap over and run it

```bash
scp scripts/basestation/bootstrap.sh edgeathlete@basestation:/tmp/
ssh -t edgeathlete@basestation 'sudo bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh'
```

The first run prints **this machine's own public key** and waits. Add it on GitHub —
the repo → **Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key** — and leave **"Allow write
access" unchecked**. Then press Enter and it carries on.

:::{note}
**Why not a `curl … | sudo bash` one-liner?** There used to be one, and it needed the
repo to be public. This one is private, and GitHub answers an anonymous download from
a private repo with a 404 — so the old one-liner would hand `sudo bash` an empty
script, which does nothing and says nothing. `-t` on the `ssh` matters: without a
terminal there is nothing to wait on, so it prints the key and stops.
:::

**To update later: `ea-update`.** Re-running this file also works — it is not
one-shot.

Installs git + Docker + NetworkManager, clones the repo to
`/srv/edge-athlete/Edge-Athlete`, generates a unique `SECRET_KEY`, detects the
Wi-Fi adapter, installs the boot service, and builds the stack. Slow the first
time — it's building images.

### 2. Set the Wi-Fi password

Ships as `ChangeMe123!` — change it before anything real:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/edgeathlete/basestation.conf
```

Edit the `AP_PASSWORD` line, save, exit. (Can also be done later from the coach page.)

### 3. Start it

```bash
sudo systemctl start edgeathlete.service
```

Brings up the "EdgeAthlete" Wi-Fi and all the containers. Comes up on its own after every reboot from here on.

### 4. Connect and open

Join the **EdgeAthlete** Wi-Fi (password from step 2), then open:

```
http://basestation
```

Coach login: **`coach` / `coachpass`**.

### 5. Fill it with demo data (optional)

Empty database otherwise. From the repo folder:

```bash
cd /srv/edge-athlete/Edge-Athlete && docker compose run --rm seed
```

A live session, the team, plans, and some finished sets.

### 6. Fake a rack sensor for a demo (optional)

No hardware needed — publishes reps only while a set is open at rack 1:

```bash
cd /srv/edge-athlete/Edge-Athlete && docker compose --profile demo up -d simulator
```

### Quick checks if something's off

All seven containers up:

```bash
cd /srv/edge-athlete/Edge-Athlete && docker compose ps
```

App healthy:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost/api/health/
```

Boot script output (AP + stack startup):

```bash
sudo journalctl -u edgeathlete.service -e
```

> **The one thing that can't be scripted around:** steps 1 and 3 need that Wi-Fi
> adapter to do AP mode. If it can't, the app still comes up (reachable over a
> cable), but there's no gym Wi-Fi — the startup log says so plainly. Everything
> else is hands-off.

Two things in that picture do most of the explaining:

**Reps never reach the server one at a time.** Follow the thick line: a rep goes from
the node to the broker to the rack screen and stops there. The screen writes it to
browser storage as it arrives, and only when the set ends does it POST the whole set
in a single request. The database gets **one write per set**, not one per rep — and a
Wi-Fi drop mid-set loses nothing.

**Django is not in the live path.** The only node traffic it listens to is heartbeats.
The screens talk to the broker directly, and there is no WebSocket layer in Django;
adding one was considered and rejected. {doc}`../journal/real-time` covers why.
