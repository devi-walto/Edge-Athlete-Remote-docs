# conf.py — the settings file that turns this folder of Markdown into a website.
#
# Read the Docs runs a tool called Sphinx, and Sphinx will not do anything until
# it finds this file. Out of the box Sphinx only reads reStructuredText, which is
# a different markup language from Markdown. Every document we have is Markdown,
# so the important line below is the one that loads `myst_parser` — that is the
# piece that teaches Sphinx to read `.md` files at all. Without it the build
# fails and nothing publishes.
#
# The other job this file does is decide what gets published. The old handoff
# documents are still sitting in this folder while we move their content into the
# new structure, so they are excluded on purpose (see EXCLUDE below). When they
# are finally retired, delete them from that list too.

# having: real tables with colons, ~~strikethrough~~, and auto-linked URLs.

# ── what NOT to publish ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The underscore-prefixed files are the OLD documents. Their content is being
# moved into the new structure; until that is done they stay on disk but out of
# the site, so the build has no "document isn't in any table of contents"
# warnings. Remove these entries as each file is retired.

    # fail_on_warning turns that into a failed build.

    # each sensor carries its own transport so the two coexist, why sensors are
    # chosen at the rack, and why broadcasts carry a revision number rather than
    # state. These three files stay out of the build because they are working
    # design documents — formal, dense, and written for the person implementing
    # them, which is a different job from the journal's. They remain the reference
    # for exact thresholds, message shapes and the validation checklist, and the
    # journal points here for that.

# `furo` is a clean, readable theme with a working dark mode and a sidebar that

# requirements.txt — nothing else needs to change.

# Furo's stock palette is low contrast in dark mode — dull grey text on near-black,

# neutral grey palette with the contrast pushed up, in both modes.
