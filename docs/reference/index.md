# Reference

Precise shapes, for looking things up — not where reasoning lives. Each page links to
the journal page that explains *why*.

**{doc}`message-contract`**
: The authority on wire formats: what sensors publish, what the server broadcasts, and
  the request and response bodies the screens are built against.

**{doc}`database`**
: A plain-English tour of every table and how they connect.

**{doc}`versioning`**
: What our version numbers mean, when each part moves, and what `1.0.0` would
  require. Short.

**{doc}`spec`**
: The original specification, kept verbatim while it is rewritten. Governing rules and
  constraints up top; the historical Phase 1–18 build prompts below them.

## Looking for the REST API?

Every route now lives in {doc}`../journal/apis`, grouped by what it touches, with the
permission and the reasoning beside each one — rather than split between a list here
and an explanation there.
